# Project Title
  An easy-to-use fluorescent cell counter and viability calculator for blue (DAPI), green (live), and red (deadO) stains. This app features customizable recognition thresholds, segmentation previews, algorithm-supported threshold recommendations, live/dead percentages, and automatic scale-bar removal.

## Biomedical Context
  This tool is designed for students, laboratory trainees, and researchers learning how to quantify cell viability using flrourescence microscopy.
  In many cell-culture experiments, viability is assessed using multicolor stains such as DAPI for nuclei, Calcein-AM or GFP for live cells, and Ethidium Homordimer/ PI (EthD-1) for dead cells. Manually counting cells is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. 
  This app provides a fast, automated, and interactive way to calculate cell counta and viability percentage tool in the biomedical engineering courses and a practical early-stage analysis tool for imaging-based experiments.
